DETAILS:

This directory contains all uploaded files/attachments for the Amberdms Billing System
if $config["data_storage_method"] has been set to "filesystem".

This directory and the SQL database contain all the data that needs to be backed up.



SECURITY NOTICE:

File download access is controlled by the PHP scripts, however this requires that
access to this raw data directory is restricted, otherwise a user could download any
file they want.

A .htaccess file has been included to provide this security.
