This directory contains scripts executed by cron on a daily basis for performing auditing,
nightly invoicing and service management tasks.

If installed from an Amberdms-provided package, there should already be a file in /etc/cron.d/
to run the scripts - if not, then please refer to the product documentation for installation
instructions.


IMPORTANT: ALL SCRIPTS MUST BE EXECUTED AS AN OPTION VIA THE INDEX.PHP SCRIPT

eg:
	$ ./index.php cron.php

If you attempt to run the scripts directly, they will not do anything. The index.php script
does some important setup work for handling multiple hosted instances.
