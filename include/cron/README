This directory contains scripts executed by cron on a daily basis for performing auditing, nightly invoicing and service management tasks.

If installed from an Amberdms-provided package, there should already be a file in /etc/cron.d/ to run the scripts - if not, then refer
to the product documentation for installation instructions.
