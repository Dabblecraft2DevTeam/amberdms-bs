ABS REPAIR SCRIPTS
------------------

The scripts in the repair directory are designed for execution by EXPERIENCED BILLING PLATFORM
DEVELOPERS ONLY and enable bulk DB changes, such as rolling back billed items and trigger rebilling of bulk runs.


Execution:

1. ALWAYS BACKUP THE SQL DATABASE BEFORE RUNNING.

2. ./index.php <scriptname> <scriptoptions>



Scripts:


credit_usage_services.php
---
Will take the specific service type and date and will create credit for all invoices generated on the specified
date that have usage of the specific item.

Will then uncheck the usage as having been billed in services_customers_periods to force the service usage to be
rebilled on the following month's invoices.


list_call_rate_differences.php
---
Will take the specific customer-service ID and will re-calculate call costs and
issue a CSV format output of all call records that are calculated as wrong.

This is useful if a particular region was billed wrong, but crediting and
rebilling the entire period is undesirable - the CSV output can be provided
to the customer, along with a credit adjustment to their account.



send_all_unsent_invoices.php
---
If a billing run has been executed without the invoices being sent and there are too many to easily send them by
hand, the following script will attempt to email any unsent invoices to customers.

If a customer doesn't have a valid email address, this script will report accordingly, although it won't pickup
syntaxally correct addresses that then later bounce.

Will run on all unsent invoices for a specific date, typically you'll want to do a bulk send of a particular billing
run period. It will also ignore any $0 invoices.
