ABS REPAIR SCRIPTS
------------------

The scripts in the repair directory are designed for execution by EXPERIENCED BILLING PLATFORM
DEVELOPERS ONLY and enable bulk DB changes, such as rolling back billed items and trigger rebilling of bulk runs.


Execution:

1. ALWAYS BACKUP THE SQL DATABASE BEFORE RUNNING.

2. ./index.php <scriptname> <scriptoptions>



Scripts:


credit_usage_services.php
---
Will take the specific service type and date and will create credit for all invoices generated on the specified
date that have usage of the specific item.

Will then uncheck the usage as having been billed in services_customers_periods to force the service usage to be
rebilled on the following month's invoices.
