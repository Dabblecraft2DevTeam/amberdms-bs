ideally suited for small and medium businesses as well as small ISPs and IT
companies.

Business software is one of the more commonly neglected areas of open source,
ABS is designed to fix this issue and deliver a solid accounting and billing

## Getting Started

Somewhat out of date documentation/manuals available at:
https://github.com/jethrocarr/amberdms-bs/tree/master/help/manual

In particular, see [the manual installation guide](https://github.com/jethrocarr/amberdms-bs/blob/master/help/manual/amberdms_billing_system_install_manual.pdf)

Recommend downloading the current `master` branch from Github, rather than
using a tarball, since bug fixes and contributions get merged, but not
doing releases very often (if ever?) now.
