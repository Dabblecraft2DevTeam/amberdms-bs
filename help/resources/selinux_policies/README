This directory contains policies for SELinux for various distributions.


To generate the rules required for ABS to perform auctions, set SELinux to permissive mode
and execute all key functions of ABS that require anything other than standard PHP/MySQL.

Then take the logs from /var/log/audit/audit.log and pass into audit2allow:
cat capturedlog | audit2allow -m amberdmsbs > amberdmsbs.te

This will work 99% of the time, however sometimes some manual adjustments are needed
to the setup.


You can generate the installable & packagable SELinux modules by running:
# checkmodule -M -m -o amberdmsbs.mod amberdmsbs.te
# semodule_package -o amberdmsbs.pp -m amberdmsbs.mod

Once generated, modules can be installed/upgraded with:
# semodule -i amberdmsbs.pp

If you need to remove the SELinux policies, use:
# semodule -r amberdmsbs
