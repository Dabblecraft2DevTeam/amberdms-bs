The documents in this directory are the source files used to generate the PDF
manuals. These are Open Document Format files, which is an open standard that
can be edited with OpenOffice, LibreOffice and other editors.

Contributions to these manuals are welcome, but take EXTREME care when
comitting changes, since Git won't handle diffing these files as they are
binary blobs from it's perspective.

You are advised to co-ordinate with the lead developer around documentation
changes to make life easier for everyone.

Long term, these will be replaced with a different formation documentation
system, see https://projects.jethrocarr.com/p/oss-amberdms-bs/issues/405/
