RELEASE NOTES
------------------------------------

Amberdms Billing System 1.5.0 Beta 1 is an incomplete development release of the billing system to enable public developer testing and feedback regarding the application.


NEW FEATURES

There are a vast number of changes in this version of the billing system, for details refer to the CHANGELOG file.

Of particular note:
* New XHTML/CSS to PDF generator and templates using the webkit engine.
* New VoIP billing features.
* New service bundling features.
* Numerious usability improvements


INCOMPLETE FEATURES

The following features exist to some extent but have large chunks of functionality still missing:
* Bank Statement import - majority of UI complete, backend processing needs lots of work
* Call records for VoIP billing can only be imported from an external database, there is no capability in the usage API for call records.
* Credit notes have only just started to be implemented.
* Upgrades to the installer/upgrader process

The following features are mostly done but do need more testing:
* New VoIP billing capabilities
* New service bundling capabilities
* New telcoperiod and telcomonth billing modes


INSTALLATION & UPGRADING

As this is not a stable release, Amberdms does not build RPM packages but instead recommends that this version be installed and upgraded from SVN.

Upgrades from previous versions SHOULD work correctly, however testing will not have been in depth, so take care when doing so and always remember to backup.

Instructions for doing so can be found on the Indefero tracker at:
https://www.amberdms.com/projects/p/oss-amberdms-bs/page/Installing-SVN/
