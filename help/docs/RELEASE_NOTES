Amberdms Billing System 1.4.1
08 March 2010

RELEASE NOTES
------------------------------


Amberdms has issued a 1.4.1 maintenance release for the Amberdms Billing
System to correct several bugs that have been reported as well as a
couple minor security issues.

We advise all users of older releases to upgrade.



SECURITY ISSUES

Two bugs have been identified - one that prevents the brute force
blacklisting from functioning correctly and another that could result in
some data shared between instances on multi-instance ABS installations.

The brute force bug prevented brute-force blocks from working correctly,
allowing an attacker to try and guess passwords by repeated attempts.


The second bug only affects a very select number of users running
multi-instance ABS installation. An issue was found where sometimes data
could linger in the cache between nightly service usage processing.

This did not appear to cause exposure of information but is being
treated as security issue information exposure could potentially occur.

Users of versions of ABS between 1.2.0 and 1.4.0 are affected and we
recommend all users upgrade to 1.4.1.



PHP 5.3

Changes have been made to support PHP 5.3 by eliminating use of
deprecated features.
